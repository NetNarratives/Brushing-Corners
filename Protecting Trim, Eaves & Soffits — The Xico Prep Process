When it comes to painting a home, the details matter — especially around the trim, eaves, and soffits. That’s why “protecting trim, eaves & soffits — the Xico Prep Process” is one of the most important parts of our work. At Xico, we know that preparation is everything. It’s what makes a paint job look sharp, last longer, and stand up to the elements.
Many homeowners don’t realize how much damage can happen if the prep work is rushed. Peeling paint, water damage, and even mold can show up later if the eaves and soffits aren’t sealed and protected the right way. At Xico, we take the time to prep these areas carefully. We clean, repair, prime, and seal before a single drop of paint is applied.
Step 1: Inspection and CleaningWe start by inspecting the trim, eaves, and soffits for any signs of damage — like cracks, rot, or loose boards. These areas are exposed to sun, wind, and water, so they need to be solid. If we find any problems, we fix them first. Then we clean everything thoroughly. We remove dirt, cobwebs, mildew, and old flaking paint. This helps the new paint stick better and last longer.
Step 2: Scraping, Sanding & FillingNext comes the detail work. Our crew scrapes off any loose paint and sands the surfaces smooth. We pay special attention to corners, grooves, and joints where paint can crack or peel. If we find small holes or gaps, we fill them with a high-quality filler that won’t shrink or crack. This gives the trim a solid, clean surface that’s ready for primer.
Step 3: Priming & SealingWe don’t skip primer — ever. Primer helps paint grip the surface and protects the wood underneath. It also evens out the surface so the final coat looks smooth and even. For eaves and soffits, we use primers designed for outdoor use, with mold and moisture resistance. We also seal the edges and joints with durable caulk, so water can’t sneak in.
Step 4: Precision Taping & MaskingBefore we paint, we tape and mask off all nearby areas — windows, siding, shingles, and gutters — to protect them from overspray or drips. This step takes time, but it’s worth it. Our painters can then focus on getting clean, sharp lines without making a mess.
Why It MattersA high-quality paint job starts with high-quality prep. At Xico, our goal is not just to make your home look great today — we want it to stay beautiful for years to come. Our attention to detail in prepping trim, eaves, and soffits helps prevent costly repairs down the road.
With the Xico Prep Process, your home gets more than just a new coat of paint. It gets protection, craftsmanship, and care that lasts.
