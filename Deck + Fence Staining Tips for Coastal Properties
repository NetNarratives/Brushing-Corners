Living in Victoria means enjoying stunning ocean views, fresh sea breezes, and mild coastal weather. But that same weather can be tough on your outdoor wood. That’s why deck and fence staining is so important for coastal properties. The salty air, moisture, and changing temperatures can quickly wear down untreated wood, causing it to crack, fade, or rot. With the right care, though, your deck and fence can look great and last for years.
Here are some helpful staining tips tailored to the Victoria climate — and how our professional wood staining services can make the job easier for you.
1. Choose the Right Stain for the Coast
In coastal areas like Victoria, you need a stain that protects against moisture, UV rays, and salt air. We recommend high-quality oil-based stains or hybrid stains that soak deep into the wood. These types of stains offer better water resistance and longer-lasting protection compared to cheaper, water-based ones. Look for a stain with mildew resistance and UV blockers to protect your wood from turning grey or growing mold.
2. Prep the Wood Properly
Before staining, your wood needs to be clean and dry. This is especially important in damp climates like ours. Any dirt, mold, or old stain needs to be removed first, or the new stain won’t soak in properly. Power washing is a great way to clean the surface, but be careful not to damage the wood. We often use a wood cleaner and brightener to prep the surface before applying stain.
3. Timing is Everything
Victoria's weather can be unpredictable, so choosing the right time to stain is key. Aim for a dry spell with temperatures between 10–25°C. Humidity and rain right after staining can ruin the finish. We monitor the forecast closely before starting any job to make sure your stain has enough time to dry and cure properly.
4. Don’t Skip the Maintenance
Even the best stain won’t last forever. In Victoria’s wet climate, it’s a good idea to reapply stain every 2–3 years for decks and every 3–5 years for fences. Regular maintenance helps prevent costly repairs down the line. Keep your wood clean and inspect it each season for signs of wear, like fading or peeling.
5. Let the Pros Handle It
Staining might seem simple, but getting an even, long-lasting finish takes skill and experience—especially with Victoria’s coastal conditions. That’s where we come in.
