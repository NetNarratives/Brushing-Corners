When it comes to protecting your building’s exterior, choosing the right product can make a big difference. That’s where the debate between elastomeric coatings vs. standard exterior paint comes in. While both options offer some level of protection and visual appeal, elastomeric coatings offer much more—especially if you're dealing with harsh weather, aging walls, or a need for long-term durability.

What Are Elastomeric Coatings?
Elastomeric coatings are thick, flexible, waterproof paints designed for exterior walls. They stretch and contract with the surface, making them ideal for buildings exposed to changing weather. These coatings form a seamless, protective barrier that resists wind-driven rain, UV rays, and even hairline cracks in stucco or masonry.

Standard exterior paint, on the other hand, is thinner and less flexible. While it can provide color and basic weather resistance, it doesn’t have the same durability or ability to bridge small cracks. That means more frequent repainting and a higher chance of moisture getting into the wall system.

Why Choose Elastomeric?
Our specialty elastomeric coatings stand out for their long-lasting performance. Designed with advanced polymers, they’re engineered to handle extreme weather shifts—hot sun, freezing temperatures, and heavy rain—without peeling or cracking. This makes them ideal for commercial buildings, coastal homes, and older properties where wall movement is more common.

Here are a few benefits:
Superior waterproofing: Elastomeric coatings act like a raincoat for your building.
Crack-bridging ability: They can span cracks up to 1/16 inch and prevent water intrusion.
UV resistance: Our coatings are designed to reflect sunlight, keeping your building cooler and protecting it from sun damage.
Longer life span: One application can last up to 10 years or more, reducing maintenance costs.

When Standard Exterior Paint Works Best
Standard paint is still a good choice for newer homes in mild climates or when budget is a top concern. It comes in a wide range of colors and finishes and is easier to apply. If your building doesn't face extreme conditions or structural issues, traditional paint might be enough for your needs—but expect to repaint every 3–5 years.

What’s Right for You?
Choosing between elastomeric coatings vs. standard exterior paint depends on your building’s condition, your climate, and how long you want the finish to last. If you’re looking for serious protection and a low-maintenance future, elastomeric coatings are worth the investment.
