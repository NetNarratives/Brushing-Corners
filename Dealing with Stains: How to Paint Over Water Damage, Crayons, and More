Stubborn stains on your walls can be an eyesore, whether they come from water damage, crayon marks, smoke, or grease. If you’re planning to repaint, simply rolling on a fresh coat of paint won’t always do the trick—stains can bleed through, ruining your hard work. To get a flawless finish, you need the right techniques and products. Here’s how to properly paint over different types of stains.

1. Preparing the Surface
Before diving into painting, proper prep work is crucial. Follow these steps regardless of the type of stain:
Clean the surface – Use mild soap and water for general stains, a degreaser for greasy areas, or a diluted bleach solution for mold and mildew.
Let it dry – Painting over a damp surface can lead to more damage or peeling.
Sand the area – Lightly sanding helps create a smooth finish and improves paint adhesion.
Apply primer – A stain-blocking primer is essential for preventing stains from seeping through.
Now, let’s look at how to deal with specific stains.

2. How to Paint Over Water Damage
Water stains leave yellowish-brown marks and can cause bubbling or peeling paint. Painting over them without proper treatment leads to reappearance.
Steps:
Identify the source – Ensure the leak or moisture issue is resolved.
Clean the stain – Use a bleach and water mixture (1:3 ratio) to kill any mold or mildew. Let it dry completely.
Prime with a stain-blocker – Use an oil-based or shellac-based primer to seal the stain.
Paint as usual – Once the primer dries, apply two coats of your chosen wall paint.
Tip: If the drywall is severely damaged, consider replacing the affected section before painting.

3. How to Paint Over Crayon Marks
Kids love expressing their creativity on walls, but crayons contain wax, which makes painting over them tricky.
Steps:
Scrub off excess crayon – Use a magic eraser, baking soda paste, or vinegar to remove as much as possible.
Degrease the area – Crayons contain oil, so wipe the wall with a degreaser like dish soap or rubbing alcohol.
Apply primer – A shellac-based or oil-based primer will prevent waxy residue from interfering with paint adhesion.
Paint with your chosen color – Once primed, apply two coats of paint for a smooth finish.
Tip: Avoid using just a water-based primer—it won’t adhere well to waxy surfaces.

4. How to Paint Over Smoke Stains
Smoke stains from cigarettes, candles, or fire damage can discolor walls and leave behind odors.
Steps:
Clean thoroughly – Use a mixture of vinegar, dish soap, and warm water to cut through soot and nicotine.
Apply a stain-blocking primer – A strong, odor-blocking primer (like Kilz or Zinsser B-I-N) is essential.
Paint over it – Once primed, apply two coats of latex or oil-based paint.
Tip: For heavy smoke damage, multiple coats of primer may be needed to fully seal in stains and odors.

5. How to Paint Over Grease Stains
Kitchen walls often accumulate grease, making painting difficult.
Steps:
Degrease – Use a degreaser or warm water with dish soap to break down oil.
Sand lightly – This helps paint stick to slick surfaces.
Prime the area – Choose an oil-based or shellac primer to seal the stain.
Paint – Apply two coats for best results.
Tip: If grease is still seeping through, repeat the priming step before painting.

Final Thoughts
Stains on your walls don’t have to be permanent. With proper cleaning, a high-quality primer, and careful painting, you can restore your walls to a fresh, flawless finish. The key is choosing the right primer for each stain type and taking the time to prep your walls properly.
